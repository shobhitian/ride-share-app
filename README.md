# Ride Share App

Introduction

The Ride Share App is a robust and scalable web application built using Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL. Inspired by popular ride-sharing services like BlaBla Ride, this application provides users with a convenient platform for ride-sharing. Key features include the ability to publish vehicles (capturing latitude and longitude), offer rides, book rides as passengers, and search for rides based on geolocation data. The API has been thoughtfully designed and optimized to support efficient geospatial queries, enabling users to find rides based on their current location and destination. Robust user authentication and authorization mechanisms have been implemented to safeguard data privacy and security. Additionally, close collaboration with front-end developers ensures seamless integration of API endpoints into the user interface.
